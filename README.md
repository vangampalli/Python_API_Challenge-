# Python_API_Challenge-

This challenge uses API from OpenWeather and Google Maps to analyze weather trends and make searches for ideal vacation locations based on those trends. Analyses for weather patterns were written in the WeatherPy.ipynb and the searches were written in VacationPy.ipynb. Observations for the data analysis are written in Data_Analysis.txt.
